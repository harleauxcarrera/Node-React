one to one project to dissector
one workspace open a time
tree structure all nodes do not need connections
  only if they are conditions
      blocks that have a field that doesnt need a connection should not show connection to other nodemon
      (address)
import the pcap
keep the packet preiview area on the bottom
 need to have button to apply dissector to the packets
 after the dissector is built u need to apply to the packets
  blocks should have drop down fields for wanted fields
    shouldnt have to drop two blocks

how to delete blocks if not wanted/needed

each box should have the ability to create a logic inside
  do not have logic/loops/
