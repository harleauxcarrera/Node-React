November 8th, 2017 // Just watched 'Section 4 Lecture 30'
  Implemented Google OAuth up to the point where

  Logging in works like this:
  Signup with google-> takes u to google sign in page-> log in on google -> makes an entry
  for the user in the database with returned credentials and then redirects
  to website. Each time user logs in after signing up, mongodb will check to see if
  user already exists by matching the ID in DB and if so, return with a cookie that grants
  access that particular visit.

  MONGODB INTRO:
  Make a 'Model Class' that acts as a monogdb collection
  A 'Model instance' refers to a single record in the collection (JSON)

  Created a mongodb instance on Mlab.com with user: harleauxcarrera pss: pLease313

  left off at section 4 lecture 33 @4:50 where initial attempt
  to connect to Mongodb instance made on Mlab.com
  using the MONGOURI

   trying to require 'keys.js' not working

Monday November 20th :
  Was able to fix the require 'keys ' file
  Next I fixed the Mlab URI and am now connecting to the instance of MongoDB on mlab
  (Lecture 34)
  Finally create new user instance in mongo User collection
    grab the user's google profile id and save to property 'googleId' defined in User model Schema
      ensure that the same user doesn't get created twice by checking User collection
      and making sure user with same googleId doesn't already exist
  left off at lecture 39
